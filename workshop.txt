[quote] [h1] Info [/h1] 
- BETA Version right now, as ai logic hasn't been tuned for the policies.

- The mod contains around 40 idea groups. With policy count going from vanilla 203 to mine 491, albeit not all unique policies.

- This is a standalone version of Ideas and Policies from my main mod which is basically EU4+ at this point.

- This should be compatible with almost anything and if not completely it shouldn't crash.

- Completely reworked policy system from the ground up that can be checked in a spreadsheet. I recommend checking the spreadsheet at least once as for compatability with other mods I did not add UI that would serve a familliar purpose.
